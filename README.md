# Multithreaded Elevator Scheduler

This Elevator Schedular is a multithreaded program which simulates passengers and elevator travel. There is one thread per elevator, and one thread per passenger. There is a fixed number of passengers, that embark on a number of trips each. These threads interact with each other through a central elevator controller.
